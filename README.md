# Models of maracuyá leaf development
Continuous developmental models of high-resolution pseudo-landmark representations of maracuyá leaves

> :white_check_mark: For a tutorial reproducing the figures shown below, please see the Jupyter notebook in this repository, [passiflora.ipynb](https://github.com/DanChitwood/maracuya_development/blob/main/passiflora.ipynb).  

**Continuous models of leaf development across node. A)** For each of 40 maracuyá species, organized and colored by morphotype, the average developmental model across 40 intervals, organized from shoot base to shoot tip. **B)** A morphospace for individual leaves colored by morphotype. **C)** Developmental models for each plant projected back onto the morphospace. Each curve represents a developmental model for a single plant, colored using a viridis color scale from the shoot base to shoot tip.

**Comparisons of manifold learning techniques for individual leaves and developmental models. A)** t-SNE, **B)** UMAP, and **C)** PHATE manifold learning techniques for individual leaves (left) or continuous developmental models (right). Samples are colored by morphotype.
